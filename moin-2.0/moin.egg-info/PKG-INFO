Description: MoinMoin - a wiki engine in Python
        ==================================
        
        MoinMoin is an easy to use, full-featured and extensible wiki software
        package written in Python. It can fulfill a wide range of roles, such as
        a personal notes organizer deployed on a laptop or home web server,
        a company knowledge base deployed on an intranet, or an Internet server
        open to individuals sharing the same interests, goals or projects.
        
        
        Documentation and Support
        =========================
        
        NOTE: moin2 is not released yet, so much information you find on the wiki
        (and elsewhere) will be about moin 1.x (and NOT applicable to moin2).
        
        There is one wiki page collecting all moin2 specific links and info:
        
        http://moinmo.in/MoinMoin2.0 < READ THIS!
        
        
        Project homepage is at http://moinmo.in/ - there are also links to support
        resources and information about MoinMoin development status and plans.
        
        In general, please make sure that documentation you read on the wiki or
        somewhere else on the web is written for the moin version you are using.
        
        For support, please try the documentation, the homepage, the irc channel
        and the mailing list before contacting the MoinMoin authors directly.
        
        If you have trouble with apache (or other webserver) configuration, please
        try reading the web server's documentation. Same thing applies for any other
        3rd party software usually used with moin, but not written by the MoinMoin
        developers.
